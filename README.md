This is a readme for a website for events in the San Joaquin Valley!

    Yesterday, the GitHub repository for this folder was initialized and committed. Today I just linked the HTML page to Bootstap CSS library because I figured that this page could be utilized by City of Fresno or DTF and won't have a super high demand for originality.

    The following are steps that I think need to be completed before moving forward:

    - In sequence what should the user see?
    - What components should they see on the page?
    - What info should the page cover?

    The page should cover all events/activity open to the public. Sports, theatre, film, music performance, art, food.drink, dance clubs, recreation, comedy.
